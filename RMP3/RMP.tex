Regression Modeling in Practice
Current session: Nov 20 â€” Dec 28
Commitment
4 weeks, 4 - 5 hours per week
About the Course
What kinds of statistical tools can you use to test your research question in more depth? In this course, you will go beyond basic data analysis tools to develop multiple linear regression and logistic regression models to address your research question more thoroughly. You will examine multiple predictors of your outcome and identify confounding variables. In this course you will be introduced to additional Python libraries for regression modeling. You will learn the assumptions underlying regression analysis, how to interpret regression coefficients, and how to use regression diagnostic plots and other tools to evaluate residual variability. Finally, through blogging, you will present the story of your regression model using statistical language.
